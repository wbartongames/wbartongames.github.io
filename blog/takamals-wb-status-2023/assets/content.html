<p>I will keep things short and to the point for this first paragraph for those that want a quick read. It has been decided that development on Takamals: Wrathful Beginnings (and any future games) will be postponed indefinitely. Takamals: Wrathful Beginnings was not far into development before deciding to stop working on it. The reason for this decision is pretty simple. The enjoyment from creating these games for myself has diminished over time, and eventually reached a point where it was no longer something I wanted to commit to in my spare time. Perhaps a more &quot;non-committal&quot; approach will re-spark the enjoyment for me in the future, which is why I use the term &quot;postponed indefinitely&quot; instead of outright &quot;cancelled&quot;. Perhaps I will come back to this eventually, perhaps not. Exactly one year ago I announced that the game would be ready for release some time in 2022, and this of course did not occur. Therefore, I felt the need to make this post for the sake of closure.</p>
<p>For any one that is curious about the development of the game, I'll share some of the plans and anticipated features below.</p>

<h3 id="anticipated-features">Anticipated Features</h3>
<p>At its core, Takamals: Wrathful Beginnings was meant to be a faithful remake of the original Takamals game using the improved engine of Takamals: Tale of Twelve Hearts. The following are some of the anticipated features for the game in addition to it being a remake. Likely not all of these were going to make it into the game even if it was released, this was really more of a wishlist to work off of.</p>
<h4 id="large-features">Large Features</h4>
<ol>
<li>Full screen app (shift overworld UI to have menus on top instead of side)</li>
<li>Takamal Classes with class advantages/disadvantages
<ul>
<li>7 classes: Attacker, Defensive, Tactical, Speedster, Aerial, Aquatic, Mystical</li>
<li>Class advantage: damage given 1.5x (3/2), damage taken 0.67x (2/3)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Permanent boosts based on type. Unlocked at level 25 and gained over time until level 45
<ul>
<li>Attacker: +20 attack</li>
<li>Defensive: +20 defense</li>
<li>Speedster: +15 speed +5 attack</li>
<li>Tactical: +20 special</li>
<li>Aerial: +10 attack +10 speed</li>
<li>Aquatic: +10 defense +10 special</li>
<li>Mystical: +5 All</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Permanent boosts: unlocked at level 45. Exchange flowers, t-shirts, cookies, or mushrooms for a permanent boost to attack, defense, special, or speed. Found in a separate building (like the shop)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="minor-changesfixes">Minor Changes/Fixes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Indicator of being poisoned (poisoned label and purple tint on Takamal). Better handling of &quot;status effects&quot;?</li>
<li>Show item used in battle screen after it is selected</li>
<li>Buff battle boost items to +20 (flower, t-shirt, etc) and fix value of money</li>
<li>Collectable items (i.e. Calculator from original game)</li>
<li>Takamal leader follows you in overworld</li>
<li>Animations in battle (walk, knock out, dodge)</li>
<li>Sound Effects in battle</li>
<li>World map and ability to teleport to visited locations</li>
<li>Fix multi-collision bugs in the overworld</li>
<li>More menu animations (such as in cutscenes)</li>
<li>Sound effects in overworld</li>
<li>Gimmicks in boss battles (such as the TTH final boss)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="takamal-tactics">Takamal Tactics</h4>
<p>An idea that came late into planning was the idea of giving each Takamal a new ability in battle called a &quot;Tactic&quot;. This Tactic ability was a limited use ability (let's say one usage of a Tactic per battle) that could help spice up the strategy of battles.</p>
<p>Some examples of planned Tactics were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retaliation: let opponent attack first, you do 1.5x damage taken</li>
<li>Thorny Shield: opponent takes 50% damage given after they attack</li>
<li>Pain Split: Combine your damage and opponent's damage and split the damage evenly</li>
</ul>

<p>That is all I wanted to share! Thank you for reading and happy new year.</p>
